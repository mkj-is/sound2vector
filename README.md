sound2vector
============

*A Processing project that converts sound files to vector PDF.*

If you want to export your sound to vector PDF, please put `sound.mp3` file into the folder containing the app/sketch. Then launch the app/sketch and wait until the app finishes playing and exporting. The file which it exports should be called `sound.pdf` and it is in the same folder as the app and `sound.mp3`. The waiting part with the music playing is a feature, it is like copying cassettes. Old school? Don't you think?

## Motivation

*P.S. Again, this is only a draft so don't expect something big.*
